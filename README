Makefile help:
  * build        : compiles the program and creates the executable files and object files
  * buildMinimal : compiles the program and creates only the executable files
  * clean        : removes all file created during any kind of build operation
  * cleanObj     : removes all object files created during any kind of build operation
  * help         : print this file
  * log          : compiles the program with a preprocessor directive which redirects all components errors in a log file. Then it creates the executable files and object files
  * speed        : compiles the program with a preprocessor directive which ignores all the sleeps. Then it creates the executable files

Project logic:
  * analyzer      : analyzer forks managers and keeps anonymous pipes with them
                    in order to stay informed
  * config        : contains preprocessor directives like error codes and flags
  * list          : a linked list implementation
  * manager       : manager forks mulpiple workers and keeps anonymous pipes with
                    them in order to get the stats gathered from files
  * priorityQueue : a prioriy queue (heap based) implementation
  * reporter      : reporter mantains two pipes:
                    * analyzer -> reporter: in order to gathers data and computes
                      a report
                    * reporter -> analyzer: in oreder to sends user's requests
  * table         : holds counting information
  * tree          : a n-ary tree with list of children implementation
  * tui           : terminal user interface 
  * work          : a worker's work
  * worker        : worker reads and computes the statistic operations on a portion
                    of a file assigned to it 
  * wrapping      : utility functions
  * main          : calls reporter and analyzer after a fork
