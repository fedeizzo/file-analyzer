Makefile help:
  * build    : compiles the program and creates an executable file named
               counter
  * clean    : removes all file creted during build operation
  * help     : print this file

Project logic:
  * analyzer : analyzer forks managers and keeps anonymous pipes with them
               in order to stay informed
  * manager  : manager forks mulpiple workers and keeps anonymous pipes with
               them in order to get the stats gatered from files
  * reporter : reporters mantains mantains two pipes:
                 * analyzer <-> reporter: in order to gathers data and computes
                   a report
                 * reporter <-> main: in oreder to sends report to the user
  * worker   : worker reads and computes the statistic operations on a portion
               of a file assignet to it 
  * wrapping : utility functions
